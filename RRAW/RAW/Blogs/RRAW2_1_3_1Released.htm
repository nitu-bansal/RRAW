        </li>
        <li><b>Currently opened Rate Request ID will be displayed on top of rate request details</b><br />
            <br />
        </li>
        <li><b>You can now get list of similar rate requests and available lanes for selected
            Rate Request</b>
            <br />
            After filtering out any particular rate request from DASHBOARD or selecting any
            particular request from DASHBOARD system will search out requests or lanes similar
            to selected request with in system and display with that selected request based
            on following fields.
            <br />
            <ul>
                <li>ORIGIN AIRPORT<br />
                </li>
                <li>DESTINATION AIRPORT<br />
                </li>
                <li>DESTINATION CITY<br />

                </li>
                <li>WD SHIWD SHIP METHOD<br />
                </li>
            </ul>
            <br />
            <b>So user will get list of requests and lanes which are similar to selected request
                based on above fields in three different categories.</b><br />
            <ul>
                <li>Rate Request Available in system similar to selected request.<br />
                </li>
                <li>Lanes which are available in master tariff and similar to selected request<br />
                </li>
                <li>Lanes which approved as ADHOC and similar to selected request.<br />
                </li>
            </ul>
            <br />
            From any above list user can explore any request or lane in detail directly by selecting
            its id. Whenever user select and lane or approved as Adhoc lane he will get that
            lane directly filtered out from master tariff or adhoc lanes list where user can
            explore or download that lane if required.
            <br />
            <br />
        </li>
        <li><b>System will not allow user to create new Rate Request if it is already available
            in system </b>
            <br />
            Whenever user generate new Rate Request system will search out existing requests
            with in system if user generating Rate Request similar to request available within
            system then System will not allow user to generate new rate request. It will give
            error like "You cannot generate new rate request for same information" and provide
            a link to explore similar request available in system with same details by which
            user generating new rate request.
            <br />
            <br />
            System will search for simmilar information in Rate Requests, Master Tariff & Approved
            As Adhoc list for following fields<ul>
                <li>ORIGIN AIRPORT<br />
                </li>
                <li>DESTINATION AIRPORT<br />
                </li>
                <li>DESTINATION CITY<br />
                </li>
                <li>MODE OF TRANSIT<br />
                </li>
                <li>WD SHIWD SHIP METHOD<br />
                </li>
                <li>CONSIGNEE NAME<br />
                </li>
                <li>MINIMUM FREIGHT RATE<br />
                </li>
                <li>FREGIT RATE (PER K.G.)<br />

                <li>SECURITY RATE<br />
                </li>
            </ul>
            <br />
            Breifing as if is there any request which is available with same details for which
            user generating new request at that system will not allow to generate new request
            it will simply give error and provide information about existing request.
            <br />
            <br />
        </li>
        <li><b>Rates will be available in tariff after 24 hours of approval from Julio (Client)</b><br />
            Whenever Julio approves a rate request as adhoc, it will be available in approved
            as adhoc list immediately. But whenever julio approves a rate request noramally,
            system will transfer that rate request to the tariff after 24 hours only.<br />
            <br />
            In between Julio can revoke that request and either can pass back to the previous
            approvers for revison or can re-approve it. In case of Julio revokes an approved
            rate request, system will reset 24hours counter and will re-apply whenever julio
            approvers that rate request again.<br />
            <br />
        </li>
        <li><b>You can now access all admin functionality from same Module (USER ADMINISTRATION)
        </b>
            <br />
            In this version we have combined all User Administrator modules in single module
            with help of PANEL. So whenever Admin users want to do any administrator work on
            any user's profile he can directly do that from this panel. It will reduce input
            of Amin User. He needs to select any normal users once and he can perform any admin
            task on that user easily by selected proper tab from panel.
            <br />
            <br />
        </li>
        <li><b>Newly added facilities in APPROVED AS ADHOC AIR RATE MODULE </b>
            <br />
            In this version we have added some new facilities in ADHOC rates module as well.
            Now user will able to transfer any lane approved as ADHOC directly to master tariff
            from ADHOC rates module. User can easily remove any lane which is approved as ADHOC
            with in system from same module. If user not able to find any required lane which
            should be available in ADHOC rates module he can generate new rate request for that
            directly from same module. System provide three different buttons for above respective
            actions.<br />
            <br />
            In short user can take following actions directly from APPROVED AS ADHOC AIR RATE
            MODULE], which is added newly.<br />
            <ol>
                <li>Transfer lane approved as ADHOC to master tariff directly.<br />
                </li>
                <li>Remove lane which is approved as ADHOC<br />
                </li>
                <li>Generate new request if required lane not available in this module.<br />
                </li>
            </ol>
            <br />
            Now to perform any of above action user need to select any particular lane. Now
            to select lane user need to click Select link available in front of each lane or
            if user searched any lane by using filter then system will select that lane by default
            as after applying filter only one lane is available in result. So in case of filter
            user have no need to select lane will get selected by system itself if only one
            lane is available after applying filter.<br />
            <br />
        </li>
        <li><b>Export to Excel function of a Tariff will now return a format simmilar to the
            existing master tariff excel sheet.</b></li>
